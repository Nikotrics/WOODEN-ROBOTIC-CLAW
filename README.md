# WOODEN ROBOTIC CLAW WITH SYRINGES

## Description
A mechanical robotic claw made from wood, syringes, nuts, and bolts.  
Demonstrates **hydraulic motion** and movements using syringes on fingers as actuators.

## How It Works
- Each finger is connected to a syringe through plastic tubing.  
- Pushing or pulling the syringe moves the corresponding movement.  
- The claw can perform basic grasping motions.

## Components
- Wooden frame  
- Syringes  
- Plastic tubing  
- Nuts and bolts  

## Applications
- Educational robotics and hydraulics learning  
- Science fair demonstrations  
- DIY robotic games
