# WOODEN ROBOTIC HAND WITH SYRINGES, NUTS, AND BOLTS

## Description
A mechanical robotic hand made from wood, syringes, nuts, and bolts.  
Demonstrates **hydraulic motion** and basic finger movements using syringes as actuators.

## How It Works
- Each finger is connected to a syringe through plastic tubing.  
- Pushing or pulling the syringe moves the corresponding movement.  
- The hand can perform basic grasping motions.

## Components
- Wooden frame  
- Syringes  
- Plastic tubing  
- Nuts and bolts  

## Applications
- Educational robotics and hydraulics learning  
- Prototype for prosthetic hand concepts  
- Science fair demonstrations  
- DIY robotics projects
